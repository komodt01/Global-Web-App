## Project Summary

### Problem
Global users experience high latency and unreliable access when web apps are deployed in a single region.

### Solution
This infrastructure accelerates and secures global access using CloudFront CDN, Route 53 latency-based routing, WAF protections, and EC2 monitoring.

### Objectives
- Reduce latency globally
- Secure origin using WAF, TLS, and IAM
- Route based on health and region
- Monitor and optimize availability and cost
